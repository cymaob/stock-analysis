        "This Python notebook is designed to analyze the performance of Tesla and Volkswagen stocks, comparing their daily returns, cumulative returns, volatility, and beta relative to the S&P 500 index.\n",
        "\n",
        "We begin by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and plotly for data manipulation, financial data retrieval, and data visualization respectively. We then specify the ticker symbols for Tesla and Volkswagen, along with the desired date range for our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we download the historical market data for these stocks and the S&P 500 index using the yfinance library. We calculate the daily return for each stock, which is the percentage change in the adjusted closing price from one day to the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then proceed to calculate the cumulative return for each stock, which is the total return from the beginning of the period to the current date. This is followed by the calculation of the volatility for each stock, which is a measure of the dispersion of the stock's returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we calculate the beta for each stock relative to the S&P 500 index. Beta is a measure of a stock's risk in relation to the market. We then compare the betas of Tesla and Volkswagen to determine which stock is more volatile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the notebook, we use various plotly figures to visually represent the data and findings. The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of Tesla and Volkswagen stocks, offering insights into their daily returns, cumulative returns, volatility, and beta."
